# A2C Mono CPU

We propose a simple implementation of A2C on one single CPU with a MLP policy.

## Note on the forward pass

* When first executing the agent of the workspace, states from `t=0` to `t=n_timesteps-1` are computed
* When executing the agent a second time, then states from `t=n_timesteps` to `t=n_timesteps+n_timesteps-1` are computed
* There is thus a missing transition between `n_timesteps-1` and `n_timesteps` that never appears in one workspace
* To avoid this effect, we:
  * copy the last state of the workspace at the first position through `workspace.copy_n_last_steps(1)`
  * Then execute the agent from `timestep=1` in the workspace
  * The resulting workspace now contains states from `n_timesteps-1` to `n_timesteps+n_timesteps-2` and the transition is not missing anymore

## Execution

```
    PYTHONPATH=salina python salina/salina_examples/rl/a2c/mono_cpu/main.py
```

## Detailed Explanations

### The Agent

We first write an `Agent` which will read an observation (the observation will be generated by a `AutoResetGymAgent` that models an environment) and will write `action`, `action_probs` and `critic` at time `t` in the `Workspace:

```
class A2CAgent(TAgent):
    def __init__(self, observation_size, hidden_size, n_actions):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(observation_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, n_actions),
        )
        self.critic_model = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(observation_size, hidden_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1),
        )

    def forward(self, t, stochastic, **kwargs):
        observation = self.get(("env/env_obs", t))
        scores = self.model(observation)
        probs = torch.softmax(scores, dim=-1)
        critic = self.critic_model(observation).squeeze(-1)
        if stochastic:
            action = torch.distributions.Categorical(probs).sample()
        else:
            action = probs.argmax(1)

        self.set(("action", t), action)
        self.set(("action_probs", t), probs)
        self.set(("critic", t), critic)
```

This agent also has additional `forward` arguments that will allow us to control how to execute it (e.g `stochastic` or `deterministic` mode, ...)

### Creating the agents for learning

* **Environment Agent**:  The first agent to create is the agent that models the environment. In the A2C case, this agent will automoatically reset the environments when reaching a final state:

```
env_agent = AutoResetGymAgent(
        get_class(cfg.algorithm.env), get_arguments(cfg.algorithm.env), n_envs=cfg.algorithm.n_envs
    )

```
Note that this agent takes the function/class name + function/class arguments as argument and will construct the environment by itself (this is need for parallelization)

* **Agent at time t**: Given the environment agent and the policy agent, we can compose them to obtain an agent that will produce at time `t` both observations, reward, etc... and also action, action_probs, critic

```
agent = Agents(env_agent, a2c_agent)
```

* **Complete acquisition agent**: While the previous agent acts at time `t`, we can obtain an agent that will act over a full `Workspace`:

```
agent = TemporalAgent(agent)
```

* **Defining a workspace**: Now we can define the workspace on which our agents will be applied:
```
workspace = salina.Workspace()
```

Once it done, the acquisition of a trajectory can be done by just executing: `agent(workspace)`.

* **Executing the agent at each epoch**: When executing the agent over a workspace, it will be executed over timesteps `0` to `time_size-1`. Then, at the next execution, the states from `t=time_size` to `t=time_size+time_size-1` will be acquired, etc.... It means that some transitions (here the one between `time_size-1` and `time_size`) will not appear in the workspace since they are split between two different workspaces. To avoid this border effect, `salina` allows one to do like this
```
        if epoch > 0:
            workspace.copy_n_last_steps(1)
            agent(workspace, t=1, n_steps=cfg.algorithm.n_timesteps-1,stochastic=True)
        else:
            agent(workspace, t=0, n_steps=cfg.algorithm.n_timesteps,stochastic=True)
```

* **Loss computation**: To compute the loss, one can get from a workspace the tensors generated by the agents:

```
critic, done, action_probs, reward, action = workspace[
            "critic", "env/done", "action_probs", "env/reward", "action"
        ]
```

Each tensor is of size `time_size x batch_size x ...`. They thus allow an easy loss computation, making the implementation of any RL algorithm quite easy.

## Next steps

* In [the next example](../mono_cpu_2), we show how modularity can be used to easily define complex agents without rewritting the base learning algorithm
* In [(here)](../multi_cpus), we show that any agent can be parallelized over multiple processes
* In [(here)](../gpu), we show how to use GPU for speeding up computation
* ...
